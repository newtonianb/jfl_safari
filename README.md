jfl_safari
==========

* Start Web Server
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

* On master branch try to click on drop down > upload.
The file dialog will open however once you select a file nothing happens (problem seems only on safari).

* Switch to working branch. The only difference was the input tag was moved out of the dropdown, this now works on safari.
